        Whey are those tears in your eyes, my child?
        How horrid of them to be always scolding you for nothing!
        You have stained your fingers and face with ink while writing-
        is that why they call you dirty?
        O, fie! Would they dare to call the full moon dirty because
        it has smudged its face with ink?
        For every little trifle they blame you, my child. They are
        ready to find fault for nothing.
        You tore your clothes while playing-is that why they call you
        untidy?
        O, fie! What would they call an autumn morning that smiles
        through its ragged clouds?
        Take no heed of what they say to you, my child.
        They make a long list of your misdeeds.
        Everybody knows how you love sweet things-is that why they
        call you greedy?
        O, fie! What then would they call us who love you?
