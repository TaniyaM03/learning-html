    <h3>Cyclone Biparjoy Live: Weather forecast for Mumbai</h3>
    <p class="para">Mumbai IMD scientist Sushma Nair said, "On Thursday evening, Biparjoy made landfall over the Gujarat
      Saurashtra coast. Mumbai has been experiencing very high temperatures because of the effect of cyclonic winds.
      Now, slowly the southwest-westerly winds will take over so the temperature in Mumbai should come down to the range
      of 33-35 degrees. Light rains will be brought by westerly winds along the western coast."

      The IMD official said the steady onset of the southwest-westerly winds will bring rain to the Konkan coast.

      "They will help in bringing light to moderate rainfall over the Konkan coast. That is the prediction we have given
      for the next four to 5 days along the coast. We are expecting maybe a little more rain in South Konkan and are
      also expecting rain in North Konkan", she said, ANI reported.</p>
